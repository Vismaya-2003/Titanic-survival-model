# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains various features like age, gender, class, and more, which are used to determine the likelihood of survival. The goal is to apply data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build an accurate predictive model.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Data Exploration
The Titanic dataset is loaded and explored to understand its structure and key characteristics. This step includes:

1. Checking for missing values.
2. Summarizing features using descriptive statistics.
3. Visualizing the distribution of various features.
   
## Feature Engineering
In this phase, key features are identified and engineered to improve the predictive power of the model. Examples include:

1. Creating a FamilySize feature by combining SibSp and Parch.
2. Extracting titles from passenger names to use as categorical features.

## Modeling
- Several machine learning models were implemented to predict survival, including:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   
Among these, Random Forest showed the highest accuracy and was selected for further processes.

## Evaluation
- The models were evaluated based on:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision and Recall
3. F1-Score
4. Confusion Matrix
   
Random Forest was fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to achieve optimal performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the entire process of building a predictive model from raw data, including data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The final Random Forest model provides reliable predictions on passenger survival.

## Next Steps
- Potential next steps include:
1. Deploying the model as a web application.
2. Exploring deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
3. Extending the analysis to other similar datasets.
