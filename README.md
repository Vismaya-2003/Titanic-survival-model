# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains various features like age, gender, class, and more, which are used to determine the likelihood of survival. The goal is to apply data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build an accurate predictive model.
